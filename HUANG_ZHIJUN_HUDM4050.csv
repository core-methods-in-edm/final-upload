This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2016-09-13 16:05:28","2016-09-13 16:05:28","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p>The paper manages to make progress and not settle with the initial knowledge tracing model based on probability but rather validates the study with experiments and successive modifications that help to address the individuality of rules and students.</p> <p>It is interesting to see the test performance evaluation be broken down into two factors, knowledge of the rules and performance parameters.

The gist of each section is as following.</p> <h1 class=""Heading2""><strong>Classification Metrics</strong></h1> <p class=""Heading2"">Classification is about predicting class labels given input data.</p> <h3 class=""Heading2""><strong>Accuracy</strong></h3> <p class=""Heading2"">the ratio between the number of correct predictions and the total number of predictions (the number of data points in&nbsp;&nbsp; the test set)</p> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>Confusion Matrix</strong></h3> <p>One might want to look at how many examples failed for class 0 versus class 1, because the cost of misclassification might differ for the two classes, or one might have a lot more test data of one class than the other.</p> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>Per-Class Accuracy</strong></h3> <p>When the classes are imbalanced, i.e., there are a lot more examples of one class than the other, then the accuracy will give a very distorted picture, because the class with more examples will dominate the statistic.</p> <p>few examples of one class, then test statistics for that class will have a large variance, which means that its accuracy estimate is not as reliable as other classes.</p> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>Log-Loss</strong></h3> <p>if the raw output of the classifier is a numeric probability instead of a class label of 0 or 1, then log-loss can be used.</p> <p>Log-loss is a “soft” measurement of accuracy that incorporates this idea of probabilistic confidence.</p> <p>related to what’s known as the relative entropy, or Kullback–Leibler divergence.</p> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>AUC</strong></h3> <p>The ROC curve shows the sensitivity of the classifier by plotting the rate of true positives to the rate of false positives.</p> <p>how many correct positive classifications can be gained as you allow for more and more false positives</p> <h1 class=""Heading2""><strong>Ranking Metrics</strong></h1> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>Precision-Recall</strong></h3> <p>Precision answers the question, “Out of the items that the ranker/classifier predicted to be relevant, how many are truly rele‐ vant?” Whereas, recall answers the question, “Out of all the items that are truly relevant, how many are found by the ranker/classifier?”</p> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>Precision-Recall Curve and the F1 Score</strong></h3> <p>By plotting precision versus recall over a range of k values, we get the precision-recall curve. This is closely related to the ROC curve.</p> <p>One way of combining these two numbers is via their <em>harmonic mean</em>:</p> <p><em>F1 = 2* precision*recall / (precision + recall)</em></p> <p>Unlike the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean tends toward the smaller of the two elements. Hence the F1 score will be small if either precision or recall is small.</p> <h3 class=""Heading3""><strong>NDCG</strong></h3> <p>DCG and NDCG are important metrics in information retrieval and in any application where the positioning of the returned items is important.</p> <p>NDCG stands for normalized discounted cumulative gain. There are three closely related metrics here: cumulative gain (CG), discounted cumulative gain (DCG), and finally, normalized discounted cumulative gain. Cumulative gain sums up the relevance of the top k items. Discoun‐ ted cumulative gain discounts items that are further down the list. Normalized discounted cumulative gain, true to its name, is a nor‐ malized version of discounted cumulative gain. It divides the DCG by the perfect DCG score, so that the normalized score always lies between 0.0 and 1.0.</p> <h1 class=""Heading2"">Regression Metrics</h1> <h3 class=""Heading3"">RMSE</h3> <p>This is defined as the square root of the average squared distance between the actual score and the predicted score.</p> <p>Euclidean distance between the vector of the true scores and the vector of the predicted scores, averaged by <em>n</em>, where <em>n </em>is the number of data points.</p> <h3>* sensitive to large outliers</h3> <h3 class=""Heading3"">Quantiles of Errors</h3> <p>robust estimators of performance that aren’t affected by large outliers, such as: median absolute percentage:</p> <p>MAPE = median (|(yi – yi )/ yi|)</p> <p>It gives us a relative measure of the typical error.</p> <h3 class=""Heading3"">“Almost Correct” Predictions</h3> <p>Perhaps the easiest metric to interpret is the percent of estimates that differ from the true value by no more than X%. The choice of X depends on the nature of the problem.</p> <p class=""Heading2"">&nbsp;</p> <h1 class=""Heading2"">Caution: The Difference Between Training Metrics and Evaluation Metrics</h1> <p>Sometimes, the model training procedure may use a different metric (also known as a loss function) than the evaluation. This can happen when we are reappropriating a model for a different task than it was designed for.</p> <p>It is always better to train the model to directly optimize for the metric it will be evaluated on.</p> <p class=""Heading2"">&nbsp;</p> <h1 class=""Heading2"">Caution: Skewed Datasets—Imbalanced Classes, Outliers, and Rare Data</h1> <p>If class imbalance is not properly dealt with, the resulting model may not know how to pre‐ dict the rare classes at all.</p> <p>Large outliers can cause problems for a regressor.</p> <p>Effective solutions for large outliers would probably involve careful data cleaning, and perhaps reformulating the task so that it’s not sensitive to large outliers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/evaluating-machine-learning-models.csp?intcmp=il-data-free-lp-lgen_free_reports_page","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since learning is dynamic and multidimensional, assessment should be an ongoing process that evaluate growth over time and promote further development, rather than a conclusion of what happened to the test and assign a fixed label to the learner.</p> <p><br />Moreover, measuring learning is difficult because the measurements are usually oversimplifications, such that we may throw away the signal and keep the noise. Moreover, the definition of learning concerns many aspects and can be composed of multiple levels, such as memorizing, understanding, applying, relating to another subject, communicating to another person. No simple test can encompass them all.</p> <p><br />The video also reminds me of the idea of customization. I understand that people’s decisions are shaped by their various backgrounds, personalities, and social context, but the business companies do not simply say, “Oh, it is so difficult to meet every individual’s needs because people are complex.” Rather, they provide opportunities for people to customize their goods, collect data about customers’ interests and send advertisement materials accordingly. I think being aware of the complexity and challenge of something is the first step; the next is to collect data, design methods to respond to the question.<br /><br /></p>","","","","Assessment; Education; educational assessment; EDUCAUSE; Higher Education; learners; Learning; Teaching and learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","470 seconds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My personal opinion on the relationship of technology and education is that teaching and learning is not only about content learning, but also human interactions and development. Technology can be used to help this learning, interaction, and development, but not to substitute it. In addition, changes that can impact education and human development need transparency and time.</li> <li>&nbsp;Regarding personalized learning, the authors suggest that only giving the information that learner interested in does not suite the purpose of a well-rounded education. I think having personalized learning to meet one’s interests and needs does not mean that one has no opportunity to expand their interests. Students can still focus on what they are interested in and good at while exploring others subjects. In short, people do not need to be terrified in seeing the word, personalized. As the authors themselves stated, personalized learning that involves student inquiry, teacher assessment, school requirement can be effective. To personalize is a complex process that requires ongoing assessment and evaluation of learning. In fact, personalized learning is to respond to students’ individuality, dynamic and context based learning.</li> </ul>","","https://theconversation.com/zuckerberg-is-ploughing-billions-into-personalised-learning-why-51940","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2016-09-13 16:05:28","2016-09-13 16:05:28","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<ul> <li>Background Information</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Data and information retrieval technology – personalized learning (How does personalized learning reduce delivery costs and increase collaboration between learners?)</li> <li>Data economy made data collection easier and more affordable than questionnaires or interviews/ behaviors of the entire constituency VS sampling/data collected from people in a natural context (not questionnaires when people know they are being analyzed), authentic and reflect uninterrupted user behavior.

We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods.

On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption).

In this paper, we present a system that can accurately detect whether a student is gaming the system, within a Cognitive Tutor mathematics curricula. Our detector also distinguishes between two distinct types of gaming which are associated with different learning outcomes.

The system can distinguish two distinct types of students who gamed in the system with high and low post test scores. The paper focuses on the gaming behavior that results in bad learning outcome. The detector is powerful since it is transferable and can be applied to new student data and new lessons. However, the authors used caution when move on to developing interventions for trying to minimize consequences if the detectors were not accurate, in other words, these are fail-soft interventions.</p> <p>Behavior detection is a very exciting topic since the detector developed can be applied to a wide range of domains when a subject is gaming the system. For instance, the classic shirking versus not shirking behaviors of a manager in labor economics can be detected using a variation of this system.</p>","","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-007-9045-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are: relatively benign uses of humor to enhance the self (Self-enhancing) and to enhance one’s relationships with others (Affiliative), use of humor to enhance the self at the expense of others (Aggressive), and use of humor to enhance relationships at the expense of self (Self-defeating). Validation data indicate that the four scales differentially relate in predicted ways to peer ratings of humor styles and to measures of mood (cheerfulness, depression, anxiety, hostility), self-esteem, optimism, well-being, intimacy, and social support. They also relate to all five dimensions of the Five Factor Model and to Agency and Communion. The first two scales overlap with previous humor tests, whereas the Aggressive and Self-defeating humor scales largely tap different dimensions. Males scored higher than females on Aggressive and Self-defeating humor. It is expected that the HSQ will be useful for research on humor and psychological well-being by assessing forms of humor that may be deleterious to health as well as those that are beneficial.","2003-02","2016-12-10 14:56:05","2016-12-10 14:56:05","2016-12-10 14:56:05","48-75","","1","37","","Journal of Research in Personality","Individual differences in uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/ziide/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/v5un4alg.default/zotero/storage/Z4NITT5A/Martin et al. - 2003 - Individual differences in uses of humor and their .pdf; /Users/ziide/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/v5un4alg.default/zotero/storage/N6VWEXPW/S0092656602005342.html","","","Measurement; Mental health; Positive psychology; Sense of humor; Sex differences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
