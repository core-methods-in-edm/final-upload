This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
D1 <- read.table("HUANG_ZHIJUN_HUDM4050.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
D2 <- D1$Title[which(D1$Notes != "")]
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
D3 <- select(D1, Author, Title, Notes)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
