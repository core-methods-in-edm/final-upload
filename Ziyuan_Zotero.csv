This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2019-09-17 21:33:16","2019-09-17 21:33:16","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>SNA: social network analysis</p> <p>Unipartite: only one type of actor</p> <p>Networks are powerful and simple way of looking at the small and vital communities </p> <p>To store and represent social network data: Matrices</p> <p>nodal data vs relational data</p> <p> </p>","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2019-09-17 21:33:17","2019-09-17 21:33:17","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p>- APT is built by a cognitive model of production rules (ideal student model) for programming knowledge</p> <p>- Goal: To implement a simple student modeling process that would allow the tutor to monitor the student's needs.</p> <p>- Four studies:</p> <p>1.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2019-09-17 21:33:18","2019-09-17 21:33:18","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p><strong>- Optimal exploitation of LA:</strong> only considered all six dimensions in the design process </p> <p>- social network diagrams not always be the best way to present information</p> <p>- Pedagogic consequences: adjustments to the didactic strategy or learning design based on the outcomes of the LA process.</p> <p>- To validate: 1. test the consistency in the descriptive values of the model 2. evaluating the growing # of LA application showcases</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct; specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically, from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive modelling are explored toward the end.","2017","2019-09-17 21:33:19","2019-09-17 21:33:19","","34-48","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p><strong>EPA: Epistemology-Assessment-Pedagogy</strong></p> <p><strong>Epistemology:</strong></p> <p>- the connection between a conceptual account of the object of measurement and a practical account of the methods and measures used to quantify activity and outputs within particular tasks. </p> <p>- the nature of the constructs, why ""count"" as knowledge, the evidentiary standard and kind required for a claim of knowledge to be made.</p> <p><strong>Pedagogy</strong></p> <p>- who the target of the device is</p> <p>- whether it supports teachers, parents, students, or administrators in understanding some aspect of learning</p> <p><strong>Assessment</strong></p> <p>- consider the ways in which the particular systems shape the data obtained</p> <p>- consider the ways in which the assessment biases particular kinds of response unintended ways</p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In both the  elds of educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) predictive modelling has become a core practice of researchers, largely with a focus on predicting student success as operationalized by academic achievement. In this chapter, we provide a general overview of considerations when using predictive modelling, the steps that an educational data scientist must consider when engaging in the process, and a brief overview of the most popular techniques in the  eld.","2017","2019-09-17 21:33:19","2019-09-17 21:33:19","","61-68","","","","","","","","","","","Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)","Alberta, Canada","","","","","","","","","<p><strong>methods for building predictive models</strong></p> <p>1. <strong>Linear Regression</strong> : continuous numeric output from a linear combination of attributes</p> <p>2. <strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> the odd of two or more outcomes</p> <p>3. <strong>Nearest Neighbours Classifiers:</strong> only the closest labelled data points</p> <p>4. <strong>Decision Trees</strong>: based on a series of single attribute tests</p> <p>5. <strong>Naive Bayes Classifiers:</strong> assume the statistical independence</p> <p>6. <strong>Bayesian Networks:</strong> provide probabilistic interpretations of classifications</p> <p>7.<strong> Support Vector Machines:</strong> find hyperplane of greatest separation between the various classes</p> <p>8. <strong>Neural Networks:</strong> propagate data input through a series of sparsely interconnected layers of computational nodes to produce an output.</p> <p>9. <strong>Ensemble Methods:</strong> use a voting pool of either homogeneous or heterogeneous classifiers</p>","","","","","Lang, Charles; Siemens, George; Wise, Alyssa Friend; Gaševic, Dragan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
