However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2016-09-13 14:42:56","2016-09-13 14:42:56","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>A generic framework for learning analytics</p> <p>***This is a great article***</p> <p>Learning analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance... improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency.</p> <p>Privacy and ethical issues</p> <p>What are information retrieval technologies?</p> <p>Goals:</p> <p>reduce delivery costs while creating more effective learning experiences, accelerating competence development, and increasing collaboration between learners.<br /><br />Data was typically collected using questionaires</p> <p>Now it is collected by mining normal user behavior</p> <p>Thus, data is more likely to reflect ""real and uninterrupted user behavior""</p> <p>Is this creepy?

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2016-09-13 14:42:57","2016-09-13 14:42:57","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","","<p>A Matrix Factorization Method<br />for Mapping Items to Skills and for Enhancing Expert-Based Q-Matrices<br /><br />Desmarais &amp; Naceur (2013)<br /><br />Map skills requires subject matter knowledge, definitions, and expert involvement<br /><br />Assist SME’s using matrix factorization<br /><br />Linear models:<br />compensatory models of skills: each skill required adds to the chances of success of an item. <br /><br />conjunctive models (Barnes, Stampers, et al) - any required skill missing will induce a failure to the item (all skills required)<br /><br />disjunctive model - any skill is sufficient<br /><br />Alternate Least Squares Factorization (ALS)<br />described p 444<br /><br />For best optimization, begin with expert matrix Q0<br />“In our experiments, the convergence at a delta of 0.001 occurs after 7–8 iterations and in a fraction of a second for factorizing a matrix of dimension 20×536.”<br /><br />ALS Method compares the expert matrix with results, and estimates values for each cell using cross validation<br />This can be rounded to create a new binary matrix, if desired<br /><br />How much the ALS matrix differs from the expert matrix can be taken as a proxy for the validity of the ALS matrix<br /><br />Note: citations from many near relations in LA: DeCarlo, Barnes, Stamper</p>","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","alternating least squares matrix factorization; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process.

This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

This does not change the data for each case, but merely reorders the cases into clusters based on the similarity of each case’s data vector, aiding dataset-wide pattern analysis and interpretation.”<br /><br />- It is valid and oftentimes appropriate to re-order data in order to reveal patterns<br /><br /><br />Some students grades can be described as high-high, high-low, low-high, or low-low. The sizes of these groups vary, but the patterns are meaningful for selecting interventions (why do some high achieving students plummet? why do some low achieving students start to improve?)<br /><br />“Recently, Balfanz et al. (2007) identified a combination of flags at the grade 6 level using logistic regression. They were able to identify 60% of the students in their sample who eventually dropped out before graduating from high school. These grade 6 flags included low attendance, unsatisfactory behavior, and failures in math and English.”</p>","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ933686","","data; data analysis; Decision Making; Dropouts; Elementary School Students; Grades (Scholastic); Identification; MULTIVARIATE analysis; School Districts; Secondary School Students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2016-09-13 14:42:57","2016-09-13 14:42:57","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","<p>USING DATA MINING TO PREDICT SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT PERFORMANCE <br />Cortez and Silver (2008)<br />Applying EDM to education in Portugal<br />Models used: decision trees, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines<br /><br />Model predicts well, with first and or second school period grades<br /><br />This paper addresses the following questions:<br />“Is is possible to predict student performance?<br />What are the factors that affect student achievement?”<br /><br /><br />Prior Research - Michigan State University<br />“Also, it was found that past school grades have a much higher impact than demographic variables.”<br /><br /><br />Provides good high level descriptions of the models used, and provides formulas describing each of the statistics (RMSE, PCC)<br /><br />“Nonlinear functions, such as Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have also been proposed for DM tasks (Hastie et al. 2001), obtaining better results when a high non- linearity is present.”<br /><br /><br />Neural Networks an dSupport Vector Machines perform their own internal feature selection.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.
